This is a demo for a website created using HTML and CSS that showcases West Virginias National and State Parks. 
The code is very simple, fully works as intended on desktop and laptops, mobile versions do not display properly and use the desktop version.
All you will need for the website to work is the HTML, CSS, and Images folder. 

Developed by: Joseph Kirk and Kendra Shamblin.
